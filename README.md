![Preview](./preview.png)

## 📋 Project Overview

SkyTrace is an interactive dashboard designed for managing and visualizing drone inspections of electrical networks across Spain. It replaces legacy Excel-based workflows with a high-performance, modern web interface.

Key Features:
- **Geographic Visualization**: Interactive map of Spain with real-time inspection statuses (Completed, In Progress, Pending).
- **Province Details**: Detailed analytics panel upon selecting a region (e.g., Madrid, Barcelona).
- **Flight Section Tracking**: Granular tracking of specific flight sections within each province.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **React + TypeScript**: For a robust execution environment and type safety.
- **Vite**: For lightning-fast development and build performance.
- **Leaflet / React-Leaflet**: handling mapping and GeoJSON rendering.
- **Modern CSS**: "Glassmorphism" UI methodology with native CSS variables and full responsiveness.
